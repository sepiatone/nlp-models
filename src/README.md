#### RNN

We explore RNN based model to perform [named entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) (NER)
The dataset we use is mit restaurants an annotated dataset of restaurant reviews. The task is to correctly identify items with the defined tags.


#### Sequence-to-sequence models without attention

We explore a RNN-based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to perform machine translation (MT).
The dataset we use is an English / Vietnamese dataset from IWSLT'15. The task is to translate a Vietnamese sentence to English.
