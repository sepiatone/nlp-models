### Overview
A testbed to explore various models / algorithms used to solve Natural Language Processing problems.

* RNNs
* LSTMs
* Sequence-to-sequence models without attention for machine translation
* Sequence-to-sequence models with attention for machine translation


### Sequence-to-sequence models without attention
We explore a RNN-based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to perform machine translation (MT). The dataset we use is an English / Vietnamese dataset from IWSLT'15. The task is to translate a Vietnamese sentence to English.
